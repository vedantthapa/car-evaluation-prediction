# car-evaluation-prediction
The authors have been given the task of analyzing a labeled car data set and performing classification to predict the evaluation category of a car based 
on inputs such as the number of seats, number of doors, safety, storage among others. The insights generated through the analysis would assist stakeholders 
in making accurate decisions based on the features a customer prefers. The analysis involves training and comparison of established algorithms such as the 
Decision Tree algorithm and the Random Forest algorithm to obtain efficient results.
